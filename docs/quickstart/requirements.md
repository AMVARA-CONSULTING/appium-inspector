title: System Requirements
---

Since the Inspector has two versions, [a desktop app and a web app](../overview.md#formats), the
requirements for these will differ.

* The web app supports Chrome and Firefox browsers
  ([Safari is not supported](../troubleshooting.md#browser-version-does-not-work-in-safari))
    * Viewport size of at least **870 x 610** pixels is recommended
* The desktop app requires up to around **600MB** of space on the computer
    * The minimum application window size is **890 x 710** pixels

The Inspector also requires an Appium server to connect to, which is not bundled with the Inspector.
This Appium server can be run either locally or remotely. Please check the
[Appium System Requirements](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/quickstart/requirements/) for more details.
