title: Attach to Session

The Attach to Session tab of the Session Builder provides the ability to connect to an existing
Appium session using the Inspector.

![Attach to Session](assets/images/attach-to-session/attach-to-session.png)

If there are no discovered Appium sessions, the dropdown is likely to be empty. But if there is at
least one session, the dropdown will automatically populate with a session identifier:

![Found Session](assets/images/attach-to-session/found-session.png)

There is also a refresh button to repeat the session discovery process.

The footer of this screen contains a link the Appium documentation, and a single button to attach to
the selected session.
